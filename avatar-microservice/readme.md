# CS361 Avatar Microservice

This service provides different colored avatars that can be associated with user accounts/comments.

## How to Request Data

Requests can be made to the Node/Express server at https://cs361-avatar-microservice.onrender.com/

Specifically, to request all avatars, make a request to /all:

For a single color, make a request to /:color (choosing one of red, green, blue, yellow, pink, or orange):

You can also request a single random color:

## How to Receive Data

After requesting data, you will receive a response in the form of JSON. For example, requesting /red would lead to the following response:

{
  "color": "red",
  "width": "200px",
  "height": "200px",
  "url": "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/avatar-microservice.appspot.com/o/images%2Favatar-red.jpg?alt=media&token=d17e13b7-c35e-4ff2-bcca-448ab5bc219a"
